=========================

## Overview

This chart provides an overview of the number of users assigned to each Department in Rally and the number not assigned.

It is simple to adjust the chart the report on a different user attribute.

The chart is particularly useful when used in conjunction with my [User Department Board](https://github.com/deadflycake/UserCards).
